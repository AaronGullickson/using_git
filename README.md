For this assignment, I want you to clone this git repository and correct the analysis that has been conducted in the `analysis.R` script. The script has some errors that will prevent it from running and some errors in calculation that produce nonsensical values and/or graphs. 

You will need to do the following to complete the assignment:

1) Clone the git repository to your own computer. See instructions below.
2) Make all the corrections necessary to `analysis.R` to produce an accurate analysis.
3) Commit your changes to your personal repository. 
4) Push those changes back to the origin repository on GitHub. 
5) Open a new issue in your GitHub repository and write a comment including @AaronGullickson that you have completed the assignment. 

## Cloning the repository

In order to clone the repository, you will first need to copy the https address from the "Clone or Download" button in the upper right of the GitHub repository. Do NOT download as a ZIP file or open in desktop.

Once you have done this, the easiest way to clone the repository is by setting up a new project in RStudio. From within RStudio, go to `File > New Project...`. Then choose the "Version Control" option followed by the "Git" option. Then paste in the https address from above for the repository URL and hit "Create Project." This will clone the git repository and set up a git tab in the upper right that will allow you to track changes, and commit and push those changes. 

Alternatively, you could have used the command line to clone the repository but this would not set up a project in RStudio which gives you the git functionality within RStudio.
